# [REDACTED]
 
[REDACTED] is a little passion project I did during my COVID break from school. 
This was the first Unity game I developed which taught me a lot of important things 
through the whole development process. I plan to make more games and share my ideas 
with all of you.  

## A little bit about the process:

Redacted was built using Unity as the core engine and Photon for multiplayer support. Most of the code
is written in C#. This project was pretty hard partially due to my inexperience with Unity and Game dev as a whole.
I learned a lot and plan to use everything I learn to make better and cooler games. I have a lot of ideas and cant 
wait to make them a reality!

## A little bit about the game itself:

[REDACTED] is a fast-paced FPS Multiplayer deathmatch game. 
The aim of the game is to simply be better than your opponents. 
Go grab a few of your friends, create a lobby, and see who is built different!

The whole reason that the game is called  [REDACTED]  is because a lot of key features such 
as animations were Redacted by a pesky virus we call 'L0GAN'. The L0GAN  virus breached our 
codebase and simply redacted a bunch of important stuff!? The goal of [REDACTED] IS to be as 
scuffed as possible!
